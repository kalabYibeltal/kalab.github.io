								<!-- Text stuff -->

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/run.jpg" alt="" /></span>One of my favorite hobbies is medium- to long-distance running. 
										I started running in my final year of undergraduate studies. My goal is someday to be able to run marathons and ultramarathons. 
										My record is 21 km. </p>
									<hr />
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/chess.jpg" alt="" /></span>My other hobby is playing chess. I have been playing chess on and off since I was around 7 or 8 years old. I have only
										played in a legit tournament once, by no means I am not a professional player. I just enjoy playing chess. If you also like to play chess,	
										you can challenge me at <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/the_professar">kalab@Chess.com</a>.
									</p>
									<hr />
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/vball.jpg" alt="" /></span>I also really like playing volleyball, although I'm not good at it. Maybe it is because I started playing it relatively late.
										But it is a sport that you can improve at any age in life, and my improvement has been noticeable since I started playing it, which is a wonderful thing to see. Try and identify me in the picture.
									</p>
									<hr />
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/swiss.jpg" alt="" /></span> Even though not mentioned in detail, I have other hobbies too,
									<ul >
										<li>I like to learn new skills. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Qf3rdBpkZk">video</a> compilation of skills I learned during the pandemic.</li>
										<li>I am also interested in expanding my knowledge of technology, world politics, economics, and physics and understanding how things work.  </li>	
										<li>It has been my goal since high school to learn a third language, I have tried to learn many different languages, and currently I am on a one-year streak learning German on Duolingo. </li>	
									</ul>
									
									Finally, No other hobby of mine has received as much time as watching movies. I have seen so much.
									</p>

									<p> Thank you for your effort to know me.</p>
